Hello everyone and welcome to Thriving Aboard! 

We started this blog to both help other people see a real life example of the liveaboard lifestyle, and to keep a journal for our own use.

This site is divided into two categories: the Blog and Articles.

The Blog will be where we put shorter thoughts about day to day struggles and current events. 
This could be anything from local and global politics to complaining about the dog peeing in the boat.

Articles are going to be longer form pieces that have the goal of helping a wider audience with learning how to live on a boat comfortably.
For example, we have plans to write such things as 'How to pick a liveaboard boat', 'Heating options for small spaces', and 'Dealing with mold and musty odors'.

This is a brand new site, so be sure to keep checking in!
