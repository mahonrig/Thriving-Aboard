Today we moved out.

Out of the marina that we had called home for over two years.

But we didn't go far.

With a short journey of a quarter mile, we moved out to the city owned moorage field.

It wasn't completely uneventful though. We first headed to the city dock to use the shore sewage pump-out (the marina's pump-out has been broken for a while, so we were mostly using the toilet on land).

Just as we were coming into the dock, I go to put the boat into reverse and it won't. _Crap_. The cables from my controls to the transmission had decided to take that moment to loosen up just enough so that I no longer had a reverse gear.

Luckily, I was more or less prepared. I yelled at Ariel (who was in the back, waiting with lines) to throw the boat into reverse. We have another steering control in the back of the boat, a life-saver when backing out of a slip or doing other tight maneuvering.

At the same time, I leapt out the front side-door onto the dock, grabbing the line I had already laid out, and quickly got it onto a cleat, slowing the boat down.

With minimal other fuss we managed to get the boat tied off, didn't even hit the dock. Possibly it even looked like we knew what we were doing.

After a thankfully uneventful pump-out, we headed out to the moorage field.

## Buoy Life

There's no facilities out here of course. Just a buoy to tie off to. No electricity, no dock.

We'll be getting back and forth to shore using the dinghy again, like we did when we spent a lot of time cruising the Salish Sea, staying at anchor everywhere we went.

I've got [400 watts worth of solar panels](https://www.amazon.com/Renogy-Monocrystalline-Photovoltaic-Battery-Charging/dp/B00B8DR6KU//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=thrivingaboard-20&linkId=e43ccdb1ea2ad8bfdc1d8530d2ebda71) waiting to be installed. That's tomorrows major chore. That and fixing the god damned transmission linkage.Â 

Once those are in we should be able to go most weeks without having to run a generator for our power needs.

The winds blowing strongly tonight, with the pitter-patter of wavelets lapping at the hull. It's quite peaceful. And we have a better view of the harbor and Seattle beyond.

More to come.
