Yesterday (Jan. 19th 2017) I finally took the step of removing the tarp that had been covering the front half of the boat
while I worked on installing the 
[4x 100w Renogy solar panels](https://www.amazon.com/Renogy-Monocrystalline-Photovoltaic-Battery-Charging/dp/B00B8DR6KU//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=thrivingaboard-20&linkId=67af01c13f3988de9e9fb44d2fc1629c) 
we purchased just before Christmas.

It was an overcast day with only brief periods of sunshine so we didn't get a lot of power out of them. But it was enough that 
I didn't have to run the generator last night. I had been running our small Honda gas genny for about two hours every night,
which has been enough to keep the battery bank decently charged.

It's near impossible to keep battery banks properly topped off using a generator though, as the final charging stage takes a 
few hours to complete. The next few days are also supposed to be gray and rainy so I'm not expecting a full charge from the panels yet, 
next week is supposed to bring sunshine again.

You can see in the picture above that there's a tall vent that's going to be casting a shadow on the panels for most of the day. I'll be 
flipping the boat around here soon and tilting the panels the other way so that they're facing the sun unobstructed. Eventually I plan on 
replacing that tall vent with a low profile solar vent. 

There's still quite a bit of other work that needs to get done. The plywood mounts need painted. The panels 
need a bit of reinforcing. I need to clean up the wiring with the battery bank down below. I have a habit 
of leaving projects half-finished â€“ functional but not pretty. Trying to get out of that habit, but 
there's so much to do!
