It's been a cold last couple of weeks.

For a while now here in the Seattle area, temperatures have been in hovering around the 20-30 degree F range. 
When it's that cold out, it seems impossible to keep the boat warm.

We have a [Dickonson Newport diesel heater](https://www.amazon.com/Dickinson-Marine-00-NEW-Newport-Bulkhead/dp/B007PS3O5I//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=thrivingaboard-20&linkId=14f84f09ff2f72019e30de0e4ed96e8d) 
mounted on the wall of the back cabin. It's a great little heater – reliable, easy to light, economical on fuel – but
it can only put out so much heat. 20 degree weather outside? That means we're getting up to only 40-50 degrees inside. Let's just say, there's 
been extensive use of sweaters.

Today we woke up to grey skies, rain, and a 43 degree air temperature. Still cold yes, but that few degrees makes all the difference 
in the ability of our heater to keep up. It's a nice 70 degrees or so as I sit here, drinking my coffee and typing up this blog post.

I'm not a big fan of having to burn fossil fuels to stay warm, but there really aren't many options for off-grid heat – fossil or biomass (wood) is about it.
The boat came with the diesel heater, and lots of tankage for storing diesel, so that's really the only option we can afford right now. 

A clean burning pellet stove may be in our future, after I do more research and save some money. 
We plan on doing an in-depth guide to heating a liveaboard boat in the near future, so stay tuned.
